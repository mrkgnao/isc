The Drover's Wife
=====

## What was the bush like?

* **Flat** country
* Stunted, rotten native **apple-trees**
* Darker green of a few **she-oaks** sighing above ...
* a narrow, near-waterless **creek**
* Maddening homogeneity and **monotony**
* It is impossible for someone who is not a bushman to distinguish one part of the bush from another

## House

* Two-roomed
* Round timber, slabs, stringy bark
* Floored with split slabs
* A kitchen made of bark stands at one end and is larger than the entirety of the rest of the house, veranda included
  * An earthen (aka "ground") floor
  * Large, roughly-made table in the center
* The nearest sign of civilization is a shanty 19 miles away on the main road

## Metaphors

It is difficult to overlook the significance of the mother, having lost her children and been forced from a comfortable existence, rising up to defend her children in the absence of her husband.

### Biblical stuff
In the beginning, she is Eve fallen from grace, solely to blame for the "original sin" which the snake of Genesis tempted her into. Alligator, who one may conceivably construe as being her "guardian angel", aids her as she -- reborn as Mary, the mother almost defined by her great, all-consuming love for her children -- stands with her foot metaphorically on the head of the snake, the enemy of woman, and consequently of all mankind. She is fierce, and her fury (unlike the she-oaks of the introductory passage, which are implied to be "darker" and inferior) is not liable to turn a cheek to this menace. Alligator kills the snake, and she tosses it into the fire, watching it burn with neither glee nor pity. 
 
### Toughness
* The lack of pity is yet another facet of the fact that her essential femininity has, by the author's own admission, been stunted and overcome by the trials of everyday life in the harsh, inhospitable bush.
