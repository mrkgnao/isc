Baltus's farm
=============

### Setting

* Banks of the **Hudson**
* One of those *green, sheltered, fertile nooks* in which "the Dutch are so fond of nestling"
* A great **elm** spread its branches over the farm
  * A **spring** of soft, sweet water at its base
  * A **well** formed of a barrel
  * The water flowed out into a **brook** which bubbled away among alders and dwarf-willows

### The barn

* Hard by the farmhouse
* **Vast**, could have served for a church
* "Every window and crevice [...] seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm"
* The **flail** could be heard within it all day
  * *flail* - a manual threshing tool formed of two sticks hinged together
* Swallows and martins skimmed about the eaves
* Rows of **pigeons** enjoyed the sunshine on the roof

### Animals

* **Pigs** - "sleek unwieldy porkers", "troops of sucking pigs"
* A stately squadron of snowy **geese**
  * ... convoying whole fleets of **ducks**
* Regiments of **turkeys** gobbled through the farmyard
* Guinea-fowls fretting about
* Strutting gallant **cock**

Ichabod's culinary imaginings (*cough*)
=======================================

### "Luxurious winter fare"

* Every roasting-pig with a pudding in its belly, and an apple in its mouth
* The pigeons "put to bed" in a pie, "tucked in with a coverlet of crust"
* Ducks paired up with "a decent competency of onion sauce"
* Geese swimming in their own gravy
* Every turkey "daintily trussed up" with its gizzard under its wing
* The cock ("chanticleer") lay on his back

### Baltus's house

* One of those "spacious farmhouses"
* High-ridged, lowly-sloping roofs
* Overhanging eaves, under which birds nested
