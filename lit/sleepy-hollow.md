The Legend of Sleepy Hollow
========================

# Baltus's farm

## Setting

* Banks of the **Hudson**
* One of those *green, sheltered, fertile nooks* in which "the Dutch are so fond of nestling"
* A great **elm** spread its branches over the farm
  * A **spring** of soft, sweet water at its base
  * A **well** formed of a barrel
  * The water flowed out into a **brook** which bubbled away among alders and dwarf-willows

## The barn

* Hard by the farmhouse
* **Vast**, could have served for a church
* "Every window and crevice [...] seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm"
* The **flail** could be heard within it all day
  * *flail* - a manual threshing tool formed of two sticks hinged together
* Swallows and martins skimmed about the eaves
* Rows of **pigeons** enjoyed the sunshine on the roof

## Animals

* **Pigs** - "sleek unwieldy porkers", "troops of sucking pigs"
* A stately squadron of snowy **geese**
  * ... convoying whole fleets of **ducks**
* Regiments of **turkeys** gobbled through the farmyard
* Guinea-fowls fretting about
* Strutting gallant **cock**

# Ichabod's culinary imaginings (*cough*)

## "Luxurious winter fare"

* Every roasting-pig with a pudding in its belly, and an apple in its mouth
* The pigeons "put to bed" in a pie, "tucked in with a coverlet of crust"
* Ducks paired up with "a decent competency of onion sauce"
* Geese swimming in their own gravy
* Every turkey "daintily trussed up" with its gizzard under its wing
* The cock ("chanticleer") lay on his back

## Baltus's house

### Outside

* One of those "spacious farmhouses"
* High-ridged, lowly-sloping roofs
* Overhanging "low, projecting" eaves, forming a piazza along the front capable of being closed up in bad weather. Under it were:
  * Benches for summer use
  * Flails, harnesses, various utensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing
* A churn, and a spinning-wheel, showed the uses to which the porch could be devoted

### Inside

* Rows of resplendent pewter
* A huge bag of wool ready to be spun
* A "quantity" of linsey-woolsey fresh from the loom
* "Strings of dry apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled with the gaud of red peppers"

* In the **best parlor**:
  * Claw-footed chairs, dark mahogany tables shining like mirrors
  * Irons, with accompanying shovel and tongs, behind "asparagus tops"
  * Ostrich egg hung from the ceiling
  * Differently-colored bird eggs strung up
  * A cupboard door, "knowingly left open", revealed "immense treasures" of old silver and "well-mended" china
