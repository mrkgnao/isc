The Lost Jewels
===

## Shiva-Kali

* There are many parallels between Bhusan-Mani and Shiva-Kali.
* The unbridled fury of Kali, as she kills the demon Raktabija and drinks his blood, is halted by Shiva, who lies down on the ground -- submitting to his wife, who is, as it were, devastation and anger incarnate -- in the all-destroying path of Kali's dance, in the hope that the blood-drunk goddess will refrain from stepping upon her beloved.
* Tagore, of course, reverses the roles in that it is Mani who leads Bhusan to what one may, after descending to the level of the corporeal, call his death -- as opposed to what happens in the mythological case, where Kali's death drives Shiva mad, leading him to assume the form of the "destroyer of worlds" as in that oft-quoted Gita passage.
* In both cases, what shines through is the great, *unconditional* love of a man for his wife. Bhusan's respectful adoration of his wife does not him an "unworthy man" of the sort sneeringly portrayed by the regressive, ultra-orthodox school-master in the story any more than the manliness of Shiva -- the archetype of the powerful, ideal, masculine male in Hindu mythology -- is diminished by the softness he bears his wife.

## Title

* The title of the story itself, when examined alongside the text itself, hints at an estrangement from more than just ornaments and valuables. "Mani" translates to "jewel", and against the backdrop of what is inarguably a tragic account of love (even if there are overtones of other, somewhat more supernatural things), there is a certain pathos to the story of Bhusan, who must lose everything he holds dear, including the wife who he but asked to tolerate -- far from returning! -- the unrequited love he bore her.

## Ending

* The open-ended culmination of the story is a (post-)modernist touch on the part of Tagore, leaving the reader to decide whether what he has just finished reading is just an account of love shot through with pathos and eventual tragedy, or a magical-realist work, blending the immediate with the mythological to give the reader a glimpse of something that may not be real, but is certainly true.

## Quotes

> There happen more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are reported in your newspapers.

(*The Hungry Stones*, Tagore)

> But the readers of this modern age are far more exact and exacting. When they hear such an opening to a story, they are at once critical and suspicious. They apply the searchlight of science to its legendary haze and ask: "Which king?"

(*Once There Was A King*, Tagore)
