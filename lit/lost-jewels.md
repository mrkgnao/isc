Remarks
======

* There are many parallels between Bhusan-Mani and Shiva-Kali.
* The unbridled fury of Kali, as she kills the demon Raktabija and drinks his blood, is halted by Shiva, who lies down on the ground -- submitting to his wife, who is, as it were, devastation and anger incarnate -- in the all-destroying path of Kali's dance, in the hope that the blood-drunk goddess will refrain from stepping upon her beloved.
* Tagore, of course, reverses the roles in that it is Mani who leads Bhusan to what one may, after descending to the level of the corporeal, call his death -- as opposed to what happens in the mythological case, where Kali's death drives Shiva mad, leading him to assume the form of the "destroyer of worlds" as in that oft-quoted Gita passage.
