(This contains liberal amounts of colloquial, "street" Bengali.)

* Opening: library. Table: Bluntschli, Petkoff, Sergius. Raina daydreaming. Catherine somewhere.

** Sergius and Bluntschli do the signing thing, Sergius engages in mild nyakamo. "This hand is more accustomed to the sword than the pen", etc. What a load of crap.
** Petkoff enquires about his coat, swearing it isn't there.
** Jewellery for Catherine against housekeeping money; Sergius' best charger against an Arab mare for Raina.
** Nicola finds the coat. Petkoff changes coats.

** Bluntschli hands out orders. "Skin taken off their backs", businesslike manner.
** Sergius tries to affect a display of kaeth; Bluntschli advises Petkoff to ... handle him.
** Catherine goes along.
** Bluntschli: something like ~"cannons out of cherry trees, wives keep discipline"

* Perem.

** Raina tries to flirt with B.
** B acts clueless, says he only told one friend about the encounter.
** R tells him that he wasn't a particularly discreet person.
** B: Don't tell Sergius k?
** R: B pls. I'm the honu you dream of being.
** B: o rly?
** R: Don't insult me. I've told two (*two*! **TWO!**) lies to save your life!
   - Ice pudding
   - "No, officer, I'm an ultra-chaste woman and wouldn't dream of hiding a man right behind those curtains, never!"
** B: That's a ton, how can I ever repay you?
** R: Etto boro spordha?

   /lightning, camera pans from left and right/

** R: How did you find me out?
** B: (proceeds to talk about how much he knows about the world.)
** R: (proceeds to self-deprecatingly talk about what a phony she is)
** B: (declares that he's an "infatuated admirer")

* Photo
** R reveals she gave him a photo.
** B is confused.
** R is apprehensive ...
** ... and B confirms her worst fears. He never found it.
   (So now her father's going to find it.)
** B: Tell him he put it there himself.
** R is ruffled and (to B) incomprehensibly anxious, until ...
** B realises R wrote some peremer kotha on the photo.

* It gets worse.
** R: Did anyone touch it?
** B: I ... uh ... pawned it. It was the logically sound thing to do.
** R: (*speechless*)
   *Louka enters.*
** B: My father's dead. I'll have to go, etc., approximately 9k hotels, ...
   (*Small exchange about B's heartlessness between R and L.*)
